As there is a lot of demand for the greeting cards, gift articles, hand bags, etc…. and in this busy world where one can hardly find time to go out for shopping and with the emerging new technologies where one can purchase products by placing an order through online by sitting at home/office either by credit cards or by VPP or through Cheque or through DD 

 

Existing Scenario : – 

 

Our client is a retail dealer of various products like gift articles, dolls, files, etc…. The customers usually visit the shop in order to purchase the products. He has a huge variety of products at his shop. Also as there is an increase in the demand of these products and as well as there is a huge variety of combinations and products available, and as the number of retail dealers are increasing day by day, it has become difficult to withheld in the market and as well to retain the customers. 

 

Also as they don’t keep track of the products, it is hard to find how many products are available in the shop. 

 

Proposed Solution : – 

 

In order to cope up in this competitive world, and to retain the customers, to automate the process, our client wants an application to be built meeting the current technology trend where the customers can place their order through online by sitting at their office/home, and providing the products as per the orders received by the dealer at the door steps of the customer. 

 

He says that he wants that the application should hold the details of the products in detail like price, description of the product and each product is allocated with a unique 7 digit product id which includes 2 digit product code and 5 digit product number. Also he says that for fetching the details of the products, the customer need not be the registered one, but for placing an order one has to be the registered user of the site. 

 

After placing an order, the dealer would dispatch the order as per the type of delivery that the customer has chosen. He says that the application should generate a unique 16 digit order number (includes the type of the delivery (1 digit) that the user has opted for, Product id (7 digit), and the order number (8 digit)) as soon as the order is placed by the customer. 

 

For the order which is placed through the credit card payment or through cheque, the payment should be cleared first and then only the product will be dispatched to the customer’s premises. Also he has provided an option like if the customer is not satisfied by the product then the customer can either replace it (new product will not be sent) or he can return it back with in a week days time, so that he can get back his money which he has paid for that product. Also the warranty card will also be provided for the products which have some warranty. 

 

The dealer alone should be able to update the details of the employees, products and their details, and he can check the orders that are received based on the date, order type (delivery) and he alone has the right to create an employee profile like username or login id and the password. The employee should only be able to change his password, and he can check the details of the orders so that the products can be dispatched as per the customer’s request and that they can be delivered in time. 

 

Also he says that there should be an option on the web site where the customer can send their feedbacks regarding the services that they attain from them.

The details of the products, employees, orders, delivery/dispatching details and as well that of the customers, are needed to be maintained using the help of the database.

The details of the payments at the time of placing an order should be captured in details based on the type of payment/dispatch that the customer is willing to have like the detailed description of the payments (credit card details if the payment is through the credit card, and cheque details if the payment is through cheque. 

The customer can only be able to cancel the order provided that the product is not dispatched from the dealer’s premises.
